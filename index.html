          <p>When you perform work, it is important to recieve proper compensation. According to the Harvard Business Review, 43% of of internship positions at for-profit companies are unpaid. This creates a barrier of entry for many people, especially those from low income. Without adequate pay, interns may feel too burdened by financial responsibilities to take full advantage of the internship opportunity. Therefore, we must take a stand and demand for fair compensation for internships. It's essential to recognize the value of interns' contributions and ensure they're not taken advantage of. By signing this petition, you can contribute towards ensuring proper compensation for interns.</p>
